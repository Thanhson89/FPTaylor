***************************
* Basic options
***************************
* If true, then absolute round-off error is computed
abs-error = true

* If true, then relative round-off error is computed
rel-error = false

* If true, then effects of subnormal computations are added to computed errors
subnormal = true

* If true, then uncertainty specifications for input variables are used
uncertainty = false

* If true, then expressions are simplified before optimization
* Maxima must be installed if simplification = true
simplification = true

* If true, then a more accurate rounding model is used.
* This model introduces non-continuous functions in optimization problems.
fp-power2-model = false

* If true, then input variables are assumed to be real numbers which
* should be rounded before they can be used in floating-point computations
real-vars = false

* If true, then round-off errors in real variables are
* constants which depend on bounds of variables
const-approx-real-vars = true


***************************
* Optimization options
***************************
* Optimization method:
*   bb (basic interval branch and bound)
*   z3 (z3 SMT solver with binary search)
*   nlopt (nlopt optimization library)
opt = bb

* If true, then an approximate optimization problem is solved
opt-approx = true

* If true, a complete optimization problem is solved
* (in general, it is harder than an approximate optimization problem
*  but may yield a better result)
opt-exact = true

***************************
* bb options
***************************
*bb-ocamlc = ocamlc
bb-ocamlc = ocamlopt
* bb algorithm (possible values: opt0)
bb-alg = opt0


***************************
* nlopt options
***************************
* spaces must be replaced with ~
nlopt-cc = gcc~-std=c99~-O3
nlopt-lib = -lnlopt~-lm
