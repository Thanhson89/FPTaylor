***************************
* Basic options
***************************
* If true, then additional debug information is printed
debug = true

* If true, then absolute round-off error is computed
abs-error = true

* If true, then relative round-off error is computed
rel-error = false

* If true, then bounds of the analyzed expressions are computed.
* These bounds are always computed if rel-error = true
find-bounds = true

* If true, then effects of subnormal computations are added to computed errors
subnormal = true

* If true, then uncertainty specifications for input variables are used
uncertainty = false

* If true, all potential overflows and invalid operations throw an exception
fail-on-exception = true

* If true, then expressions are simplified before optimization
* Maxima must be installed if simplification = true
simplification = true

* If true, then a more accurate rounding model is used.
* This model introduces non-continuous functions in optimization problems.
fp-power2-model = false

* If true, then round-off errors in real variables are
* constants which depend on bounds of variables
const-approx-real-vars = true

* If true, then some second order error term expressions are
* estimated with a selected optimization procedure.
* This mode is slower but can yield more accurate results.
intermediate-opt = false

* Optimization options

* Optimization method:
*   bb (basic interval branch and bound)
*   z3 (z3 SMT solver with binary search)
*   nlopt (nlopt optimization library)
*   gelpia (GELPIA tool)
opt = bb

* If true, then an approximate optimization problem is solved
opt-approx = true

* If true, a complete optimization problem is solved
* (in general, it is harder than an approximate optimization problem
*  but may yield a better result)
opt-exact = true

* Optimization tolerance
opt-tol = 0.01
